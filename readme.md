## by Moses Okonji


## Dataset

> [Bay Wheels] is used to be known as Ford GoBike. It is a regional public bike sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California and the first regional and large-scale bicycle sharing system deployed in California and on the West Coast of the United States with nearly 1,000,000 rides since the launch in 2017.
It had about 10,000 annual subscribers as of January 2018. The dataset used for this exploratory analysis consists of monthly individual trip data for the year 2018 covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

## Summary of Findings

> Our analysis of Bay Wheels Ride Data for 2018 revealed that are two different user groups for the bike sharing system. The subscriber group and the customer group. The subscriber group consisted of 89% of the total bike sharing system while customers group consisted of 11%. There were more male riders than female riders. Riders in this age bracket (25 to 40) years old tend to have a higher bike usage and this usage drops with increasing age.
Subscribers tended to have much shorter trips compared to customers and they use the system heavily on work days mainly between 8-9am and 17-18pm for work commute, whereas customers ride a lot over weekends and in the afternoon for leisure and tour purposes. 
Majority of the rides from these two groups occurred in the summer season and the less during the winter months.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> * Subscribers use the system heavily on work days i.e. Monday through Friday whereas customers ride a lot on weekends, especially in the afternoon.
  * Most trips peak between 8-9am and 17-18pm on work days for subscribers, whereas customers ride a lot over weekends and in the afternoon for leisure and tour purposes. 
  * The uniform period of usage observed for subscribers relate to their high concentration on rush hours during weekdays, indicating the use is primarily for work commute, whereas the customers use it differently in a more relaxing and flexible pattern mainly during weekends and in the afternoon, probably for city tour or leisure purposes.
